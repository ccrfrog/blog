
You have a full-time job and are also doing
a part-time evening course. You now find that you cannot continue the course. 
Write a letter to the course tutor. In your letter

* describe the situation
* explain why you cannot continue at thie time
* say what action you would like to take


Dear MR PI,

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable 
to continue with the part-time computer programming
course.

I have been attending your evening classes for the last two months, and have enjoyed them immensely. As I stated on my course application form, I work full-time for a large IT company, and until now I have managed to fit the course into my schedule.

However, my company is currently on the verge of signing a contract with an important new client in China, and I am part of the team that is being sent
to Beijing to negotiate terms and conditions. I will
probably be out of the country for several weeks.

I am aware that you run the same course twice a year. Rather than try to catch up when I return from China, I was wondering if it would be possible for me to join the next cohort in September.


I look forward to receiving your response.

Yours Sincerely


George Winberg
