Dear Juan Juan,

I hope this letter finds you well. I heard you moved to a new apartment near your
company recently, since I'll leave for Seattle next week, I guess some of my furniture
might be useful to you.


I have a 3-seat couch, and a desk-chair suit for single use.
The couch is 1.8 meters in length and 0.8 meter in depth, it goes with
2 cushions which are quite comfortable. If you have a visitor, he/she can
sleep in the couch for several days without any complaints. The desk-chair suit is a 
multi-function one, It fits in up to 3 laptops and a large monitor.
I've beeing using them for along time, but they are well maintained, and look like
90 percent as new ones.

Since we are busy at working days, I suggest you come and see the furniture by yourself 
on this weekend at anytime. Please give me a call before you leave for me.
We can discuss the details of trading face to face.


Best Wishes.
Truly George
