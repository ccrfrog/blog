Dear Mr & Mrs Jackson,

I'm writing to apologize for the noise the other day.
We were redecorating the bathroom on Wednesday, and the noise-reduction device for the drill
went down on the halfway, and we cannot stop the work because of wet cement.

I am sincerely sorry for the unhappiness brought by the noise, please receive the fruit
basket as a make up. I hope you forgive me for the accident.


To avoid the recurrence, I have asked the workers from the construction company to bring a spare
noise-reduction device, and not to do the noise produce job at rest time.


Yours Faithfully

George Winberg
