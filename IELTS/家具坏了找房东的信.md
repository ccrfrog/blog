Dear Mrs May,

This is your tenant George who moved in your apartment since February 2016 with my family.
I'm writing with regard to the problem of the window in the living room.

It seems that the window in the living room lost its function of wind and water proof.
When it's raining outside, the water will leak in from the window and wet the floor.
I think it's harmful for the wooden floor and other furniture in the room because of humidity.
And it sometimes makes a weird noise which is quite annoying in the night.


I've contacted the decoration&fixing company. They told me it's because of the aged rubber that
seals the window. They offered two ways to solve this problem, change the seal strip add extra 
rubber or replace a new window. I hope you can come and see the problem on your own and help
me decide a way to solve this problem. 

Please contact me at any time on 13720029116..


Your Faithfully

George Winberg
