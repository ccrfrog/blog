Dear Sir or Madam,

This is George Winberg, a regular customer of your supermarket who lives nearby in Sunshine Town section #2.

I am writing with regard to the minor accident I encountered in your supermarket. 
It was about 18:30, 2016-09-16, when I passed by the seafood section, I fell down because of the slippery floor. I guess the staff just cleaned the floor, and left water on the ground due to a carelessness. There was no sign alongside, and the light was not bright enough to notice the wet. Fortunately it brought no injury 
except some pain, I did not go to hospital.

I suggest you set up a sign when the floor might be slippery, and equip with a brighter lighting in the seafood section to avoid similar accidents in the future. 

I have been a satisfied customer of your supermarket for several years, I hope this letter draw your attention. Thanks for your time to read this letter. 


Yours faithfully


George Winberg
