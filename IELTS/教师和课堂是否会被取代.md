Some people think typical teaching of a teacher and students in the class will not exist
by the year 2050. Do you agree or disagree?


The topic of whether traditional teaching with a teacher and students sitting in a classroom
will disappear in the coming years seems to ignite public debate recently. According to my 
perspective, the traditional way of teaching will exist for a long time.


With the power of computer and Internet's growing in an unexpected way, remote or online education 
becomes widely accepted and increasingly popular. It's totally understandable for people believing 
that the traditional way of teaching will vanish in less than 50 years. The online education breaks
the limit of time and location, even the amount of students - thousands of students can take part in
a course at the same time. In addition, the online course is so easy to spread that it sometimes gains
enormous attention unexpectedly.

Given the advantages above, I believe the mordern online education will boom in the future. However ther are disadvantages that can hardly be changed in the future. For example, what can we do for the lack of interaction
in a online course? It's nearly impossible to conduct a dangerous chemical experiment without hand-by-hand instructions. Moreover, the online way is to emotion expressing and physical education such as music and arts, it's defeated by the face to face way.

However 
it does not necessarily mean typical teaching method will disappear.
